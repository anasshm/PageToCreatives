## 🚀 Next Steps

### If Test Looks Good:
Run full tagging on all 50K videos:
```bash
python3 tag_research_videos.py "Research last OCT6.csv"
# Type 'n' for full mode (not test mode)
```

This will take ~2-3 hours and create a complete tagged gallery.

### If You Want to Adjust:

#### Add More Shapes:
Edit `product_taxonomy.json` and add new shapes:
```json
{
  "shapes": {
    "new-shape": {
      "primary": "new-shape",
      "synonyms": ["synonym1", "synonym2"],
      "description": "Description"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Change Synonyms:
Edit the `synonyms` array for any existing tag.

#### Re-run Test:
```bash
python3 tag_research_videos.py "Research last OCT6.csv"
# Type 'y' for test mode again
```

## 💡 Observations from Test

### What Works Well:
- ✅ Earrings are accurately identified
- ✅ Shapes are correctly detected (circle, geometric, flower)
- ✅ Colors and materials are tagged
- ✅ Pairing keys are generated for matching

### What to Check:
- 🔍 Are clover/quatrefoil designs detected? (Not in this test sample)
- 🔍 Are butterfly designs detected? (Not in this test sample)
- 🔍 Necklace detection accuracy (only 1 in sample)

**Note:** The test sample happened to be mostly earrings. Your full dataset likely has more variety including the clover/butterfly designs you showed me earlier.
