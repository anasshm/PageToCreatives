# Structured Scoring System Update

## What Changed

The watch comparison system now uses **structured attribute scoring** instead of vague overall similarity scores.

## How It Works

### 1. Separate Scores for Each Attribute

The AI now scores 4 attributes independently (0-100 each):

- **SHAPE** (35% weight) - Watch case shape, proportions, overall form
- **STRAP** (25% weight) - Strap/band type, style, texture, width  
- **DIAL** (25% weight) - Dial design, markers (arabic/roman/minimalist), hands style
- **COLOR** (15% weight) - Color scheme (least important, shade differences OK)

**BRAND is completely ignored** - it has 0% influence on scoring.

### 2. Weighted Final Score

Final Score = (Shape √ó 0.35) + (Strap √ó 0.25) + (Dial √ó 0.25) + (Color √ó 0.15)

### 3. Consistent Results

Unlike before, the AI now:
- Compares specific attributes (shape vs shape, strap vs strap)
- Uses clear scoring guidelines for each attribute
- Shows you the breakdown so you can see WHY it scored that way

## Example Output

```
  [5/48] üìä Final: 87.3 | Shape: 92 | Strap: 88 | Dial: 85 | Color: 78

üèÜ Best match found!
   Product #: 5
   Final Score: 87.3/100
   ‚îî‚îÄ Shape: 92/100 (35% weight)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Strap: 88/100 (25% weight)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Dial: 85/100 (25% weight)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Color: 78/100 (15% weight)
```

## CSV Output

Both CSV files now include detailed scores:

**Watched_prices.csv:**
- `final_score` - Weighted final score
- `shape_score` - Shape similarity (0-100)
- `strap_score` - Strap similarity (0-100)
- `dial_score` - Dial similarity (0-100)
- `color_score` - Color similarity (0-100)

**Watched_prices_detailed.csv:**
- Same detailed breakdown for ALL products (not just the best match)

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Consistent** - Same images will get same scores every time
‚úÖ **Transparent** - You can see exactly why a product scored high/low
‚úÖ **Prioritized** - Shape matters most, color matters least
‚úÖ **Brand-agnostic** - Brand names have zero influence
‚úÖ **Dial-aware** - Arabic vs Roman numerals are properly compared

## Adjusting Weights (Optional)

If you want to change the importance of each attribute, edit line 354-360 in `watch_prices.py`:

```python
final_score = (
    scores['SHAPE'] * 0.35 +   # Change these weights
    scores['STRAP'] * 0.25 +
    scores['DIAL'] * 0.25 +
    scores['COLOR'] * 0.15
)
```

Make sure they add up to 1.0 (100%)!
