# Dual Output Update - Watch Prices

## Summary
Updated `watch_prices.py` to provide **TWO outputs** in the CSV for each watch search:
1. **Best Match** - The product with the highest similarity score (like before)
2. **Cheapest 90%+** - The cheapest product among those with 90%+ similarity (NEW)

## Key Changes

### 1. Improved AI Prompt ‚úÖ
Now uses the same improved prompt as `cheapest_watches.py`:
- Focuses on **shape and material** only
- **Ignores** color shades, brand differences, or missing brands
- More accurate similarity scoring

### 2. Dual Output Logic ‚úÖ
The script now:
- Processes all products with the improved similarity scoring
- Identifies the **best match** (highest similarity score)
- Filters products with **90%+ similarity**
- Among the 90%+ products, finds the **cheapest one**
- Saves **both results** to the CSV

### 3. New CSV Format ‚úÖ

**Old format:**
```
reference_image_url, 1688_url, 1688_product_image_url, price, similarity_score
```

**New format:**
```
reference_image_url,
best_match_url, best_match_image_url, best_match_price, best_match_similarity,
cheapest_90plus_url, cheapest_90plus_image_url, cheapest_90plus_price, cheapest_90plus_similarity
```

## Usage

Run the script exactly as before:
```bash
python3 watch_prices.py
```

The script will:
1. Ask for your watch image URL or local file
2. Search for similar products on 1688
3. Analyze all products using the improved similarity scoring
4. Output **TWO results**:
   - **Best Match**: The most similar product found
   - **Cheapest 90%+**: The cheapest product with 90%+ similarity
5. Save both to `Watched_prices.csv`

## Example Output

```
üèÜ Best match found!
   Score: 95/100
   URL: https://1688.com/product-x
   Price: ¬•89

üí∞ Found 3 products with 90%+ similarity
   Product (Score 95): ¬•89 = 89.0 yuan
   Product (Score 92): ¬•44 = 44.0 yuan
   Product (Score 91): ¬•55 = 55.0 yuan

üèÜ Cheapest 90%+ match found!
   Score: 92/100
   Price: ¬•44 (44.0 yuan)
   URL: https://1688.com/product-y

‚úÖ Successfully processed URL - found best match
‚úÖ Found cheapest 90%+ match
```

## Benefits

1. **Better comparison**: See both the most similar AND the cheapest good match
2. **Price optimization**: Quickly identify cheaper alternatives that are still high quality
3. **Improved accuracy**: The new prompt focuses on what matters (shape/material)
4. **Flexibility**: You can choose between highest quality match or best value

- `cheapest_watches.py` - Alternative script (only returns cheapest 90%+ match)
