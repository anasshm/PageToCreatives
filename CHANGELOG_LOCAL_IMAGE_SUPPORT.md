# Changelog - Local Image Support for Watch Finder

## Date: October 9, 2025

## Latest Update (v1.1)

**Fixed:** Escaped space handling in file paths from drag-and-drop

When dragging files from Finder/Explorer into the terminal, the system automatically escapes spaces with backslashes (e.g., `Screenshot\ 2025-10-09\ at\ 10.55.13\ PM.png`). The script now automatically handles this.

**New Function Added:**
- `normalize_file_path(path)` - Handles escaped spaces, quotes, `~` home directory, and relative paths

**Changes:**
- Both `watch_prices.py` and `watch_prices_api.py` now normalize file paths before checking existence
- Removes quotes if present
- Converts escaped spaces (`\ `) to actual spaces
- Expands `~` to user home directory
- Converts relative paths to absolute paths

## Summary

Added drag-and-drop functionality for local image files to both watch finder tools (`watch_prices.py` and `watch_prices_api.py`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `watch_prices.py`

**New Functions:**
- `upload_local_image_to_imgur(image_path)` - Uploads local images to Imgur and returns public URL
- `is_url(path)` - Checks if input is URL or local file path

**Updated Functions:**
- `main()` - Now accepts both URLs and local file paths
  - Validates local files exist and are valid images
  - Automatically uploads local files to Imgur
  - Supports mixing URLs and local paths
  - Better user prompts and progress messages

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Drag and drop support in terminal
- ✅ Validates file existence before processing
- ✅ Validates image format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic upload to Imgur for public URL
- ✅ Supports multiple files separated by `|||`
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing/invalid files
- ✅ Clear progress indicators for file preparation

### 2. Modified `watch_prices_api.py`

**Same changes as watch_prices.py:**
- Added `upload_local_image_to_imgur(image_path)` function
- Added `is_url(path)` helper function
- Updated `main()` to accept local file paths
- Added file validation and upload logic

**Special Notes for API Version:**
- API version (TMAPI) requires URLs from Alibaba platforms
- Local files are uploaded to Imgur first
- Imgur URLs may not work optimally with TMAPI
- Recommendation: Use browser version for local files

### 3. New Documentation

**Created `LOCAL_IMAGE_USAGE.md`:**
- Comprehensive guide for local image support
- Usage examples for single/multiple files
- Drag and drop instructions for macOS/Linux
- Supported image formats list
- Troubleshooting section
- Comparison of browser vs API versions

**Updated `README.md`:**
- Added "Watch Finder Tool" section
- Explained local image support feature
- Quick start examples
- Links to detailed documentation

**Updated File Directory:**
- Listed new tools and documentation files
- Added watch finder scripts to main documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Imgur Integration

Used Imgur's anonymous upload API:
- Public client ID: `546c25a59c58ad7`
- No authentication required for uploads
- Free and reliable image hosting
- Returns permanent public URLs

### File Validation Flow

1. Check if input starts with `http://` or `https://`
   - If yes → Use as URL directly
   - If no → Treat as local file path

2. For local files:
   - Verify file exists using `os.path.exists()`
   - Validate it's a valid image using `PIL.Image.open()`
   - Display image size and format
   - Upload to Imgur
   - Use returned URL for product search

3. Error handling:
   - Skip invalid files with clear error messages
   - Continue processing remaining valid inputs
   - Show summary of skipped items

### User Experience Improvements

**Better Prompts:**
- Clear instructions for URLs vs file paths
- Examples for single/multiple inputs
- Examples for mixed URLs and files
- Drag and drop hints

**Progress Indicators:**
- "Preparing input X/Y" messages
- File type detection (`[URL]` or `[File]`)
- Upload progress for local files
- Validation success messages

**Error Messages:**
- "File not found" for missing files
- "Invalid image file" for corrupt/unsupported files
- "Imgur upload failed" with reason
- Graceful skip with "⏭️" indicator

## Testing Recommendations

Test the following scenarios:

1. **Single local file:**
   ```bash
   python3 watch_prices.py
   # Input: ./Watches/A1.png
   ```

2. **Multiple local files:**
   ```bash
   python3 watch_prices.py
   # Input: |||./Watches/A1.png|||./Watches/A2.png
   ```

3. **Mixed URLs and files:**
   ```bash
   python3 watch_prices.py
   # Input: |||https://example.com/img.jpg|||./Watches/A1.png
   ```

4. **Drag and drop:**
   - Run script
   - Drag image from Finder to terminal
   - Terminal auto-fills path

5. **Error cases:**
   - Non-existent file path
   - Invalid image file (e.g., text file)
   - File path with spaces

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing URL-based workflows unchanged
- Old command patterns still work
- No breaking changes to API or output format

## Dependencies

**No new dependencies required!**
- Uses existing `requests` library for HTTP
- Uses existing `PIL` for image validation
- Uses built-in `base64` for image encoding
- Uses built-in `os` for file operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. Support for other image hosting services
2. Batch upload optimization for multiple files
3. Image preprocessing (resize, crop, enhance)
4. Clipboard support (paste images directly)
5. GUI for easier drag and drop
6. Progress bar for large batch uploads

## Notes

- Imgur free tier has no practical limits for this use case
- Images uploaded to Imgur are public but unlisted
- Local files are temporarily downloaded for Gemini comparison
- Temp files are cleaned up after processing
- Browser version recommended for local files
- API version still best for Alibaba platform URLs
